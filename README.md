## Inspiration
Have you ever joined a discord server, excitedly introduced yourself, then received a dead response? Or feel so hopelessly awkward that you just wish there was an easier way to break the ice and meet new people?
Fret not, **Ice Pick** is here to save the day! Simply type in commands like trivia or wur and Ice Pick will break the ice for you. Now you just have to let your personality shine!

## What it does
Ice Pick is an **ice-breaker bot** designed to be used in groups. It offers fun group ice breaking games like **trivia quiz**, where you can compete to be the highest scorer and typical ice-breaker games like **Would You Rather** where you get to not only learn about others but also yourself.

Not only that, if you are tired of typing, you can switch it up a bit and look at some **memes** together. Ice Pick will be responsible for getting you random memes from subreddit r/programmerhumour.

## How we built it
This bot was built with python using the discord.py library.
To make it extensible, we decided to modularize our code, making each command standalone. 
To keep our bot running 24/7, we deployed it on Google Cloud Platform. Feel free to join our [test server](https://discord.gg/n75TWHhA) and try the bot for yourself!

## Challenges we ran into
1. Firstly, we faced some issues in finding an api that we can use (many of which either have limited calls or restricted our access). We managed to overcome this by searching extensively for other api’s and fortunately managed to find replacements. 

2. Understanding how to use discord.py also took some time as it was the first time any of us had used this library.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a working Discord bot over a short timeframe of 2 days. Given that most members of the team did not have any knowledge on developing bots prior to the hackathon, it is a big accomplishment for us to put together the many features of our bot, Ice Pick.

## What we learned
1. Within these short two fruitful days, we familiarize ourselves with the workings of Discord bots (an exceptional achievement particularly for those of us so disconnected from the gen-z world that we never used discord before).
2. On top of that, we’ve found interesting APIs and integrated them into various parts of our project. 
3. Brainstorming sessions allowed us to further think from the users perspective on what would be interesting and fun.

## What's next
1. We hope to add more games and features so that there can be more variety and choices for ice-breaking. 
2. Interest based matchmaking to allow server members to find other common interests with one another, strengthening friendships.
